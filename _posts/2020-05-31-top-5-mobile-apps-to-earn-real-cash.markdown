Most apps require you to spend money, but did you know that there are apps you can use to make money instead?

That's right, you can earn a few dollars by filling out surveys and offers, or even using the app itself. Granted, you won't be able to live off that, but it's still a great way to earn some money for yourself!

However, it can be a good way to get some extra pocket money (or at least some cash) to pay gym fees, or to buy a paid app. Below are 5 apps to help you earn real money for yourself - in the form of discounts, free offers, and even free gym memberships.

### **1. Google Opinion Rewards**

The app pays you for answering simple surveys that can be used as Google Play credit. How many surveys you’ll get per week heavily depends on your location and your activity. From 1-5 surveys a week, you may even never get a survey at all. Just try to answer surveys honestly and you should be able to get at least 1 survey per week.

Other than that, you can probably get $5 worth reward if you play daily for 2 weeks
