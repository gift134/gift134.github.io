## How It Works

Taking online surveys is simple, though getting started can take a bit of time. Here are the steps involved:

1. Find a company to sign up with. Included a list below of companies to check out, but there are hundreds of legitimate companies out there.

2. Create and fill out a profile. You’ll need a separate profile for every company you do surveys for, and you’ll want to fill out each profile as completely as possible. Each survey is targeted to a particular demographic, so the company won’t send you a survey unless they can tell from your profile that you fit the demographic they want.

3. Get surveys. Most survey companies will notify you of available surveys by email. Some are immediately available for you to take. For others, you may have to spend a couple of minutes answering presurvey questions to ensure that you fit the demographic. If you do, you can go on to take the survey (and get the reward). Other times, you may get products in the mail that you’re meant to review.

4. Take surveys. Just answer questions. Sometimes it’s as simple as answering a few multiple-choice questions. Other times, you may need to type out long-form answers to more specific questions.

5. Earn rewards. The rewards process varies dramatically from one company to the next. Some companies give you points, which you can redeem for cash or other rewards. Others transfer money immediately to your PayPal account, and still, others enter your name into sweepstakes drawing.
