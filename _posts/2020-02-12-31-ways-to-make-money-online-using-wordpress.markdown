### **3. WordPress Advertising Plugin**

Instead of opting for Google Adsense, you can sell ads directly to third parties directly. This way you can earn money without a third party involved. Give some space on your website on rent, where the advertiser can put his ad. You get money for this place.

This is a bit of a hassle though. You need to find a buyer who wants to sell ads on your website. You need to put forth terms and conditions, make the contract, manage the ad space and come to an agreement upon the pricing. Most bloggers charge a flat rate. This is convenient because it saves you tracking clicks and impressions.

There are advertising plugins available on WordPress that are dedicated to this purpose, for example, BuySellAds. These plugins help you manage your advertising process.

### **4. Paid Reviews**

Have you ever read a movie review? Felt that it was more on the side of a bias? There must be many reviews you have seen that seem to be promoting the product. In most cases, these are paid reviews.

**What is a Paid Review?**

It is a review of the product or service for which you get paid. There are infinite products available out there. You can pick up niche you like and start reviewing products related to it. For example, you can review smartphones, kitchen equipment, DIY tools. You can start for free. Once you build an audience, you can monetize your reviews.

There are sites like SponsoredReviews who match businesses with bloggers. Those who are interested in a paid review can contact you or you can directly contact companies asking for doing a paid review for them.

In a paid review, you get the product free for trying it out. You need not invest in the product. Your job is only to review the product. Unbiased products are popular among the readers and give you credibility. You can even become an authority in your niche by your honest paid reviews. So choose to review the products honestly.

This is little different than affiliate marketing. In affiliate marketing, you straightaway recommend the product. In Paid reviews, however, you just need to review the product. Of course, you can make your review as biased as you can. It totally depends whether you want short term gain or long term gain. Biased reviews pay of only in short term.

### **5. Flip Websites**

One other way of earning money that is different than the ones mentioned earlier is Flipping website. Now, What is flipping a website? Flipping simply means selling your already established website.

Not everyone knows how to build a website. Fewer have a type of website that is in trend. If you have one such site with you, you can sell it and earn money from it. Most entrepreneurs don’t have time to build their own site. So they buy an already existing site and build on that.

You know how to build a website. You can use this knowledge to build websites that are in demand. If you could get a traffic to your site, then it is a big plus! You can subscribe to auction sites where you can sell your site for a bid.

### **6. Sell Sponsored Blog Posts**

What are the sponsored blog posts?

These are the blog posts that talk about the specific product or a service of a company and the company sponsors this post (you are paid for your blog post).

With sponsorship, you represent a product, talk about it and promote it to your audience.

For this to work, you need to build an audience first. You need to have statistics about your followers, traffic on your website, target audience etc. so that you can present it to a company and negotiate a sponsorship deal.

This is a very good way of earning money. Some bloggers hate placing ads on your blog. Interestingly, by writing a sponsored blog post, you are doing a full-fledged ad about the sponsored product.  So, there is no logic behind saying that you don’t like ads.

### **7. Sell Members-only content:**

You can restrict access to certain content on your blog and make it “members only”.

You can ask money for membership. This is a very reliable way of making money.

There are lots of membership websites in the world. You can keep certain part of your website free for the world and keep certain content specifically for the members. You give special access to the members for your exclusive content.

### **8. Private Forum**

Just like a membership site, a private forum is a forum exclusive to certain people. In private forums, the discussions are not accessible to non-members.

You can start private forums about any niche you want. For example, you can start a private forum about ethical hacking. Other ethical hackers both experts and newbies can join you. You will host topics in these forums. Once people benefit by participating in your forum, word will spread and you will earn more day by day.

The key here is to charge a reasonable amount to participate in your private forum. The contributors to the forum and the topics discussed add to the enigma of your forum.

There are many plugins that can help you set up a private forum. One of the most popular and community supported plugins is **bbPress.**

### **9. Job Board**

You can create a job board. If you have access to specific audience companies are looking for they will pay you to display their vacancies at your job board. This is especially true for a niche or a locality. There are so many job portals but they do not cover every locality and niche. You can bridge this gap and offer companies access to particular talent.

You just need to curate and update the list from time to time. You need to make sure job seekers find it easy to access your website. Your income largely depends on how beneficial your job board is for the companies that pay you to get listed on your job board.

A niche is something that you should focus on. It minimizes your competition and proves fruitful to both the job seekers and job providers.

Creating a job board with WordPress is easy. There are so many plugins available for that. There are specific add-ons in WooCommerce that can help you create a job board.
